He does the next best thing: He purchases a gun. This is despite Marge's stern opposition to having a gun. Homer plays with the gun like a toy and almost causes an accident at the dinner table. Marge warns Homer to get rid of the gun now; Homer agrees, but Bart finds the gun later in the refrigerator. Marge sees this, takes the gun away and tells Homer she is taking the kids and moving out. Homer eventually is kicked out of the local NRA chapter (for his careless use of the gun), and decides he needs to try to get Marge back. Eventually, he manages to foil Snake's armed robbery at the hotel where Marge is staying. Homer finally gets rid of the gun, but Marge decides to keep it for herself.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0MTAzMzgxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTM3Mjg4MzE@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.2/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"8.2","votes":"992","imdbid":"tt0763039","seriesid":"tt0096697","type":"episode","response":"True"}
