Bart finds a way around the directive and opens his gifts at 5 a.m. However, his prized gift - a remote-controlled fire truck - overheats and causes a fire that engulfs the tree and presents. The family investigates and Bart tells them that a burglar has struck. As a result of Kent Brockman's human interest story, the entire town donates gifts and cash to the Simpsons for their \"misfortune.\" Eventually, Bart admits the truth, angering his clueless family but angering the town even more (when Brockman finds out the truth). The family is made into outcasts, and Marge's attempt to win the needed funds on \"Jeopardy!\" (to pay everybody back) fails miserably. Eventually, the townspeople loot the Simpsons' home ... save for a dust rag.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMzc2MDI4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODc2NTQ2MjE@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.6/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"7.6","votes":"882","imdbid":"tt0701176","seriesid":"tt0096697","type":"episode","response":"True"}
