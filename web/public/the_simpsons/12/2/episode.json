In the Town Hall, after the Mayor's meeting about the change, Homer discovers that all the rich people live on one side of Springfield, with the old code, and Homer is left to try and manage with the new code. However, he protests, and ends up splitting Springfield into Old and New. Homer desperately tries different ways to tackle Old Springfield, but in doing so, he only makes them richer when they discover gold at the bottom of the river. Homer finally builds a large wall to separate the two sides, and remembers that The Who are planned to stage at Springfield for a concert. Will Homer manage to convince The Who to play on his side of town instead of the other's?","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0MTAzMzgxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTM3Mjg4MzE@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.5/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"7.5","votes":"742","imdbid":"tt0701049","seriesid":"tt0096697","type":"episode","response":"True"}
