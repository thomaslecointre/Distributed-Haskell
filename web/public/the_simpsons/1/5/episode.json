Bart and one of Nelson's goons get into a fight at school (when Bart was sticking up for Lisa), and in the aftermath Nelson accidentally gets a bloody nose. Nelson makes good on his threats to beat up Bart. Bart winds up having nightmares about Nelson stalking him, and later envisions his funeral. Finally, Grampa takes Bart to Herman, a Vietnam veteran who has had one of his arms amputated, to plan a strategy for getting back at Nelson. Bart commissions all his schoolmates whom Nelson has bullied and - in a classic parody of war movies such as Patton - trains them for their revenge. One afternoon after school, Bart and his army enact their operative, pelting Nelson and his goons with water balloons until he surrenders. The revenge is successful, and Bart and Nelson begin a grudging friendship.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BNjkzMjAzMzc4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDY2NTQ2MjE@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.1/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"8.1","votes":"1575","imdbid":"tt0701059","seriesid":"tt0096697","type":"episode","response":"True"}
