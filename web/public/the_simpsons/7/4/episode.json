Lovejoy disciplines Bart for a prank he pulled in church - he tricked the organist into playing Iron Butterfly's \"\"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\" - he and co-conspirator Milhouse begin arguing over whether man really has a soul. Bart scoffs at the notion and agrees to \"sell\" his soul (a piece of paper with the words \"Bart Simpson's Soul\") to Milhouse for $5. A series of situations makes Bart realize maybe he really did sell his soul, prompting him to go all-out to get it back from Milhouse, who isn't willing to sell. Meanwhile, Moe attempts to open a family-style restaurant inside his tavern, with the gimmick that if he doesn't smile when servicing a customer, the meal is free. Moe's surly demeanor and the stress of running such a business alone conspire to do the establishment in.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0MTAzMzgxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTM3Mjg4MzE@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.7/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"8.7","votes":"1242","imdbid":"tt0763025","seriesid":"tt0096697","type":"episode","response":"True"}
