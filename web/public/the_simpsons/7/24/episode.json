Failing at that, he nearly sparks a riot and gets shot at with a cannon(ironically for Peter Frampton) which bounces a fake pig off his fat belly, and ends up being hired as part of the festival's freak show, touring with bands such as Smashing Pumpkins, Cypress Hill, Sonic Youth, and yes, Frampton.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0MTAzMzgxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTM3Mjg4MzE@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.0/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"8.0","votes":"1010","imdbid":"tt0701127","seriesid":"tt0096697","type":"episode","response":"True"}
