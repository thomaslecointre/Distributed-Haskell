Gabbo turns out to be a ventriloquist dummy whose show airs directly opposite the Krusty the Clown show. Having beaten off hordes of competition before, Krusty laughs off the threat, but while Gabbo's star rises, Krusty's falls. His show is unceremoniously canceled. Broke, obese, and desperate for work, he turns to Bart and Lisa for help. Eventually they persuade many of Krusty's celebrity friends (Johnny Carson, Bette Midler, Hugh Hefner, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and his half-brother Luke Perry) to join him in a TV comeback special.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjczZDFhOTItZTc2OS00MTYxLThlODktNzI0ODFhNTZhNTEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjcwMzEzMTU@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.2/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"8.2","votes":"1346","imdbid":"tt0701148","seriesid":"tt0096697","type":"episode","response":"True"}
