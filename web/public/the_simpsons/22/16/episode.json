But when Cheech and Chong take the stage in front of their loyal fans, the jokes were just not the same for Chong, so Homer steps in and delivers all the punchlines by heart. Impressed, Cheech invites Homer to go on tour with him as new duo \"Cheech and Chunk\" while Chong forms a more progressive comedic team, \"Teach and Chong,\" with Principal Skinner. While Homer is on tour, Marge attempts to help the neighborhood cat lady and change her hoarder ways, but turns into a hoarder herself in the process, and Homer realizes that life on the road is not all high times and slapstick humor.","languages":"N/A","country":"N/A","awards":"N/A","poster":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxMTg1MDYxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDM4MTA3NA@@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.1/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"6.1","votes":"432","imdbid":"tt1628655","seriesid":"tt0096697","type":"episode","response":"True"}
