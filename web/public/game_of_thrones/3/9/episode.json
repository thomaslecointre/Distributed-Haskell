There is considerable tension between the two families but Robb's sincere apology for not marrying one of Frey's daughters is well received. It doesn't stop the elderly Frey from being both crude and rude towards his guests. Edmure is pleasantly surprised to see that his bride is to be Frey's prettiest granddaughter, Roslin. The festivities continue but Walder Frey has something very special planned. Arya and Sandor Clegane arrive at the Twins but too late to do anything.
