His plans to entrap the Lannister's army are now ruined. At King's Landing, Tywin Lannister relieves Baelish of his duties as treasurer and assigns the task to his son Tyrion, who openly admits that he has far more experience spending money than managing it. While collecting the accounting books at Baelish's brothel, Tyrion has a gift for Podrick. In Astapor, Daenerys decides to buy all 8000 of the Unsullied and offers one of her dragons as payment. North of the Wall, the surviving members of the Night's Watch try to stay alive. They stop at Craster's keep and Samwell sees that Gilly is giving birth. Jaime manages to convince his captors that Brienne could bring a hefty ransom provided she is unharmed and left with her virtue intact. His captors agree but Jaime is forced to pay a dear price.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODUzODk3NjQ4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjkxNTcyOQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.9/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"8.9","votes":"12716","imdbid":"tt2178802","seriesid":"tt0944947","type":"episode","response":"True"}
