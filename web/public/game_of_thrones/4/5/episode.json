Cersei can see that her newly-crowned son and Margaery are exchanging friendly smiles. Cersei is surprisingly frank with her about Joffrey and asks if she is still interested in being queen. Tywin tells Cersei of the Lannisters dire financial situation and needs the Tyrell family to be part of the crown. Jorah Mormont advises Daenerys of Joffrey's death and they contemplate attacking King's Landing by sea. There is other news as well. The freed slaves of Yunkai have been re-enslaved by their old masters and a coup in Astapor has enthroned a butcher who has declared himself emperor. Daenerys decides to rule over the territories she has conquered. Sansa and Petyr Baelish arrive at the Eyrie where he introduces Sansa as his niece Alayne though her aunt, Lady Arryn, is aware of her true identity. Brienne and Pod continue their journey but Pod proves to be a not very useful squire.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTE4MzQ4OTA5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjQxNzI3MTE@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.7/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"8.7","votes":"13366","imdbid":"tt3060856","seriesid":"tt0944947","type":"episode","response":"True"}
