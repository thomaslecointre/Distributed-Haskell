While he goes hunting with his brother Renly he puts Ned on the throne. A group of farmers complain of having been attacked by a Knight and his army and knowing the culprit orders him stripped of all titles and lands. Ned decides to send Arya and Sansa back to Winterfell for their protection. Sansa in particular doesn't want to leave saying she wants to marry Joffre and have blond babies. Her offhand remark leads Ned back to the book his predecessor was so interested in and he now understands why John Arryn was visiting King Robert's bastard children. Meanwhile, Daenerys and her brother Viserys have yet another confrontation but this one is settled by Drogo himself.
