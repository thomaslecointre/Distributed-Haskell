Playing in the dungeons, Arya overhears two men plotting against her father. She tells him what she heard and he decides the time has come for him to return to Winterfell.

The delay is costly however and leads to a serious injury. Catelyn meanwhile takes Tyrion to her sister Lysa, who also happens to be the John Arryn's widow.","languages":"English","country":"N/A","awards":"N/A","poster":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg4NjU0NjMzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTczMDYyNQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"9.1/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"9.1","votes":"14957","imdbid":"tt1829964","seriesid":"tt0944947","type":"episode","response":"True"}
