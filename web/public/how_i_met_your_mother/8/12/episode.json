The one friend who won't be there is Barney, who admits to Ted that he is planning on asking Patrice to marry him that evening. Barney swears Ted to secrecy. Ted however feels that Robin has a right to know if only because he believes that she still loves Barney. Ted has to decide if his vow of secrecy to Barney or Robin's lifetime happiness is more important. If he does decide to tell Robin, that may signify that he himself has finally let Robin go romantically. Marshall and Lily are able to attend the ceremony as Mickey has given them an early Christmas present: twenty-four hours of consecutive babysitting service. This time will be their first extended time away from Marvin, and they are looking forward to it.
