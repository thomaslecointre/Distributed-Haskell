Robin and Barney are so adamant that Jeanette not be Ted's +1 that Barney swears Ted to secrecy in how he is helping Ted find an alternate +1: by staging plays from his playbook, which he purportedly burned in front of Robin but in reality burned a fake book instead. If Robin finds out about the playbook, there may be no reason for Ted to have a +1 as there will be nothing for him to bring a +1 to. Meanwhile, Lily, as The Captain's new art buyer, is attending a gallery showing by an up and coming artist named Strickland Stevens. Marshall is confident that he can play the art buyer husband at functions so important to Lily's career which may not be the most obvious fit for Marshall. This gallery showing may test Marshall's actual ability in this role.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5NTYwNjg1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzIzMTUxOQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.1/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"8.1","votes":"1799","imdbid":"tt2668726","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
