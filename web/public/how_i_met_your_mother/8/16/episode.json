It isn't easy to get her out without her causing major destruction because of her crazed state. Beyond Ted trying to figure out how to get her to leave, his friends try to figure out if Jeanette's current behavior is all her fault. Meanwhile, Marvin is eight months old, and no one has realized that Robin has never been left alone with him, nor has she ever picked him up, which is due to fear of the unknown. When Lily leaves Marvin with Robin on an emergency, an incident happens between Robin and Marvin about which Lily would probably be quite angry. Robin decides not to tell Lily about what happened... at least not yet.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczOTM4ODM3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTU5MDMyMjE@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.6/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"7.6","votes":"1646","imdbid":"tt2676388","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
