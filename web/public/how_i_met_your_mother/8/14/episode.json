Wearing an engagement ring, Robin eventually comes to the realization that the ring is making her invisible to men, and as such they don't lavish her with gifts as they used to do. She has to decide whether the ring or the free gifts and attention are more important. And although Barney says he is disgusted by Ted dating twenty year old Carly with who he only has a mutual physical attraction in common (she who is into \"old\" guys), Barney needs Ted to sleep with her if only to live through Ted vicariously. Ted, however, is thinking of breaking up with Carly without ever having slept with her unless he can find something, anything, as a common emotional ground between the two of them. Barney's need for Ted to do this act may be affected by beautiful Carly herself. And Marshall is sporting a new look as it is turning Lily's crank, but that look has an unexpected negative side effect. Marshall has to decide if the side effect is worth the passionate sex with Lily.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDU0NzcwOTc5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTk0MjEwOQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.0/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"8.0","votes":"1834","imdbid":"tt2630114","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
