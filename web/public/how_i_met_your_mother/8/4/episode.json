As they complete their will, they run into the obstacle of who they will name as Marvin's guardian. As they exhaust the list of all their living blood relatives, dismissing each for one reason or another, their thoughts turn to their three best friends, who all actively campaign for the position. That campaigning irks Marshall and Lily, who decide to choose between the three using one of Marshall's passions in life. The question becomes how much of the unusual scrutiny Barney, Robin and Ted will endure for the opportunity to be Marvin's godparent and potential guardian.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjI1MTQ3MjU2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTI1NTg1OA@@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.5/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"7.5","votes":"1580","imdbid":"tt2428796","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
