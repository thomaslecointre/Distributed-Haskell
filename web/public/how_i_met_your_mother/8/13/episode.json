During their battle, they eventually admit to the other why they want to focus their attention on this task. Despite the less than the traditional loving relationship she has with her father, Robin still wants Barney to go through the ritual of asking him for her hand in marriage, which Barney is afraid to do because of Mr. Scherbatsky's cold and unfriendly demeanor. But Robin learns that her father has gone through a transformation - at least in his own mind - the reason for such which could affect his role in the wedding.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTQwMzI5NjI1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjQ3NDA5OA@@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.9/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"7.9","votes":"1509","imdbid":"tt2569148","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
