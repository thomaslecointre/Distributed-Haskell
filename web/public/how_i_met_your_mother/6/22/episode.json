Needing to find a job with a purpose, he gets an opportunity as the lawyer for the Save the Arcadian group headed by Zoey. This move places Marshall and Barney at odds with each other. Their feud escalates to the point of a fight which gets not only them but the rest of the gang banned from MacLaren's. The ban has the equally annoying result for Robin and Lily of relinquishing their booth to a woman who has been hovering and preying on it. Robin and Lily decide they need to mount a scheme to get Marshall and Barney back to being friends, the scheme which entails plying them with a myriad of different cocktails to get them into a specific mood at each stage of their reconciliation. Meanwhile, Ted has stayed out of the Marshall/Barney fray much as he has stayed out of the disagreement of the Arcadian with Zoey: they just don't talk about it. But as Ted and Zoey are about to head off for a romantic getaway, Ted feels it is time for them to talk about it and he makes a move that he thinks will get Zoey to his way of thinking about the Arcadian.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTgzMDU3NDQzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjM0MDQxNQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.9/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"7.9","votes":"1315","imdbid":"tt1795964","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
