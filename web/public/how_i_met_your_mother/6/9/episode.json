Robin considers it a children's educational show about two teen-aged girls solving crimes in space using math. As the others watch the show, they feel that it more closely resembles porn wannabe. Despite stating that she and Jessica were BFF's, Robin hasn't been friends with Jessica for about five years. Ted deduces that Robin's friendship ended when Jessica had a child, which makes Lily believe the same thing will happen to her when she and Marshall have a baby. Since Robin won't talk about it, the only other person who could tell the gang the full story is Jessica Glitter herself. Meanwhile, Ted wants to prove that unlike Robin and Jessica, he and his old friend Punchy truly are BFFs. But when Punchy unexpectedly takes Ted up on an offhanded offer, Ted's assertion is tested.","languages":"English, French","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5MDM5MzgwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjkxMDAxNA@@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.6/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"8.6","votes":"2029","imdbid":"tt1763611","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
