Lily sees this \"date\" as dangerous territory for the two of them since Zoey is a married woman, and they all think Zoey's husband, George van Smoot who Zoey and by association the gang call \"The Captain\", has a sinister air about him. It becomes even more awkward for Ted when Zoey lies to the Captain, she telling him that she is out with \"friends\" plural. Lily believes the only way for Ted's friendship with Zoey to continue is if he includes the Captain in their outings. But when Zoey can't make the planned outing - a sailing trip - Ted is afraid for his life having to spend 6 long hours alone with the Captain in open water. Meanwhile, Robin and Marshall, who realize they never spend time alone together, decide to go out to dinner without the others. Their evening could not be more awkward, which they both realize. Marshall attributes the awkwardness and the two of them never spending time alone together based on something Barney calls \"the mermaid theory\". And Lily and Barney get into an argument over something that Lily says to Barney... or so Ted in 2030 remembers not so correctly.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTEyMjQ0OTQ0MTBeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDA1Njk2MTQ@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.0/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"8.0","votes":"1697","imdbid":"tt1779155","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
