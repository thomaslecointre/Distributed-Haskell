The issue of the Arcadian has placed a strain between Barney and the rest of the gang, especially now that Marshall is working as Zoey's lawyer and Ted, despite being the GNB headquarter's architect, is now siding with Zoey on the issue, more to support her than perhaps he truly feeling that the Arcadian is a building worth saving. Ted has second thoughts when he learns that Barney will lose his job if he states at the hearing that he supports keeping the building as a landmark. Ted's friends question him about the reason he is siding with Zoey and whether it will have the effect he desires. On the flip side, will Zoey support Ted regardless of what he states at the hearing? Lily believes she's come up with the solution to help Ted, Barney and Marshall.","languages":"English, Japanese","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5NDkwNzI4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzcxNTEyNQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.8/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"7.8","votes":"1233","imdbid":"tt1795965","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
