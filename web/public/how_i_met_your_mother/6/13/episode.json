So their doctor sends them to Dr. John Stangel, the best reproductive endocrinologist in New York City. He ends up being Barney's doppelg√§nger, although Lily is convinced that he's actually Barney in disguise. Both Lily and Marshall have problems going through the tests with Dr. Stangel for different reasons. They are both on tender-hooks as they await news from Dr. Stangel if there are any issues in them being able to conceive a child. Other news in their life may overshadow whatever Dr. Stangel might have to say. Meanwhile, Robin has just started her new job at Worldwide News. She hates it primarily because the anchor, her old co-host Sandy Rivers, divulges some facts and not so facts about Robin to the rest of the staff which make her the laughing stock among her colleagues. Ted helps her come up with a way to deal with this new embarrassing situation.","languages":"English, Japanese","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4NDA5NjU2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzIyMTcyNA@@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.8/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"8.8","votes":"2066","imdbid":"tt1795967","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
