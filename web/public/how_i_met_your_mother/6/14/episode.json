At funerals, Robin always plays the role of \"vice girl\". Ted and Barney come to a decision that the best way they can help Marshall is to make him laugh during the day. And Lily vows to help Judy through the day despite the two never having been that close. The day gets off to a shaky start when their regular priest, Father Platt, can't perform the service, leaving that task to his son, Reverend Trey Platt, who, during their growing up period, was Marshall's nemesis, despite a physical disparity between the two. In preparing for the service, Marshall is asked about the last words his father ever spoke to him. As Marshall remembers back to the last day he saw his father, all he can remember are meaningless words uttered instead of something profound. Marshall then realizes that he has yet to listen to his father's last words to him. He's not sure he can as he explains why he needs those last words to be something important.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4ODk3ODkyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTYwODQzNA@@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.5/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"8.5","votes":"1819","imdbid":"tt1795956","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
