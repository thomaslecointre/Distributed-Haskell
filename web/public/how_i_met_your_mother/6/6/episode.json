Marshall and Lily's individual lists outline one fundamental difference between their wants, which dawns upon Marshall: he wants a boy and she wants a girl. As the Eriksens seem to have a long history of producing boys, Marshall has to decide if he will heed the unusual advice of his father to get what he wants. Unknown to Marshall, Lily's actions may thwart his own plans. Meanwhile, Robin hates her new co-anchor, Becky, a helpless woman who acts more like a little girl than a woman. Robin learns that the little girl act turns men on, much to her chagrin. But what bothers Robin even more is that Becky is turning on one guy in particular. And as Robin and Lily believe that the little girl act turning on guys is creepy, Barney appoints his new challenge to be to pick up a woman using only a little boy act. Completing the challenge ends up being harder than he imagined.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0NTMwNDgxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjU4MTMwNA@@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.8/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"7.8","votes":"1348","imdbid":"tt1737328","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
