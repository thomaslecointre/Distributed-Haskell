He still denies that it means anything. But when Nora tells him up front that she only wants to date men that have the potential of being husband material, Barney does indeed tell her that he too is looking for a serious relationship. Does he mean it or is it all an act just to get her into bed? Barney himself may not even be sure, Lily is pretty sure she knows what he's really feeling for Nora, but only Barney's cardiologist may be able to tell for sure. Meanwhile, Robin is thinking about getting a dog again. Marshall tells her that her want for a dog is to replace the man missing from her life and that she really should go out and look for her next relationship. She follows Marshall's advice and picks up a guy she meets nicknamed Scooby, a fellow Canadian. But in Scooby, Robin may have gotten her original wish.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk5NjgzNDA1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ3MDMyMjE@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.4/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"8.4","votes":"1723","imdbid":"tt1795960","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
