Offended by the piece, Ted feels he and his friends are definitely not fat cats, despite their all attending, courtesy of GNB, a black-tie fund-raiser at the Natural History Museum. There, Lily learns that Marshall has aspirations to be a fat cat, which she has to reconcile with her own feelings of what she wants from her husband. Barney and Robin go on a quest to touch as many \"do not touch\" objects they can in the museum. Along with a past trip by Barney to the museum, their quest has an unexpected consequence concerning Barney's life. And Ted meets one of the fund-raiser's primary benefactors, George Van Smoot - self-nicknamed \"The Captain\" - who happens to be Zoey's rich, older husband. The interaction between the Captain - who actually likes Ted - Zoey, and Ted leads to slightly altered positions in the Ted/Zoey fight, and not just over the Arcadian.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI1ODYyNzc0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzIzODcwNA@@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.2/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"8.2","votes":"1689","imdbid":"tt1757176","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
