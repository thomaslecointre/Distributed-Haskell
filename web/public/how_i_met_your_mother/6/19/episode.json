Barney and Jerry have an evening out to get to know each other, but each has a slightly different telling of the events of the night and how each views whether they have a future as a family. When Barney's friends learn what actually happened that night, they feel that Barney needs to experience Jerry's life - which means meeting Jerry's current family - to come to terms with Jerry's life during Barney's growing up period versus Jerry's life now. Meanwhile, Barney blames his lack of knowing how to use tools to not having a father figure to show him how while he was growing up. The gang discuss the gaps in knowledge each of the others has, which each somewhat admit to when confronted. However, Marshall seems not to have any of these knowledge gaps... or so the others seem to imply.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ1OTkwNzI1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTc3OTc2NA@@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.4/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"8.4","votes":"1825","imdbid":"tt1795961","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
