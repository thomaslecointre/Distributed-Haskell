Ted and Barney will be going with her, but not Marshall and Lily, as they have been doing a lot of \"Classy grown-up things\", as she referred it to and thinks it may be time for she and Marshall to grow up and put behind the things they used to do back in college. While at the club, Robin runs into problems as she cannot get into the VIP Room, then while outside trying to get it straightened out,a different front door bouncer will not let her in, even though she is on their list to get in, but her name is crossed off and shown she is already in. Meanwhile, Ted realizes that he is not crazy for nightclubs. Marshall and Lily wonder if doing all those \"Classy gown up things\" are all that great and Barney ends up getting into a very embarrassing situation that is so bad, he tells Ted what happened and that \"this night did NOT happen\" (in italics).","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTU5MTQyOTY2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTM4MDMyMjE@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.4/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"8.4","votes":"2430","imdbid":"tt0606109","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
