He decides to rent a limo (driven by their old cabbie friend Ranjit) which will take them to each of their five chosen parties in three hours, and return to the best one by midnight to ring in the new year. They are on a tight time schedule so there is no room for change or improvisation from the plan. Not included in their night is Robin as she is planning on spending it with her new boyfriend Derek. But in her place is Ted's date, the unusually friendly Marybeth. The night starts off well, but one wrench after another another is thrown into the plan, some which are definite nuisances, while others they gladly accommodate. But even those in the latter category don't always come off as they anticipate, especially when it involves one of the group needing to head off alone. Will they be at their dream party at midnight and will they all be together?","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyOTYzNTczMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzg3MDMyMjE@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.4/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"8.4","votes":"2262","imdbid":"tt0606114","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
