Beyond Shelter Island not being quite the place that Marshall, Lily or Barney want to be, the wedding faces some immediate issues when Stella learns that Ted has telephoned Robin in Japan to invite her to the wedding, the invitation which she accepted. This move violates Stella's no-ex's at weddings policy as she fears that Ted seeing his ex will bring up old, unresolved feelings. The only thing that could be worse for Stella is if Lucy's father, Tony, was at the wedding. Ted is torn as he really would like Robin, one of his best friends, there. Lily thinks that she has a plan to get Stella to allow Robin to attend, but that plan has some unexpected consequences. When Robin arrives, she has her own admission for Ted.","languages":"English, Japanese","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjA1MTc3OTQxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzk0OTk5MQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.3/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"8.3","votes":"1468","imdbid":"tt1256187","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
