So when Ted, Marshall and Lily are packing up the apartment to move on with their respective lives, Ted finds the intervention box with envelopes addressed to him. The others admit that they were going to hold an intervention when Ted first got engaged, believing he was rushing into things, but decided not to after they got to know Stella. As Ted makes them read their letters anyway, Ted comes to realize that they may be right, which in turn makes Marshall and Lily realize that moving to their new apartment does not feel right, and makes Robin realize that moving to Japan does not feel right. Only Barney, trying to win a bet that he, wearing make-up and pretending to be eighty years old, can still pick up a twenty-two year old, may inadvertently have something to show the other four about the matter.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjIwNDI4NzA1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTk3MDMyMjE@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.8/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"8.8","votes":"1737","imdbid":"tt1256186","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
