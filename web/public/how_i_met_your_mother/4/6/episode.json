Lily in particular thinks that Ted isn't dealing with what he is really feeling, while Barney thinks that Ted may indeed be happy in believing that Stella perhaps was not the one for him. Ted admits that part of the way he is dealing with the situation is to avoid running into Stella at all cost. But when the five go out for dinner and see Stella in the same restaurant, they go to extraordinary lengths to make sure she doesn't see them. While Ted contemplates if he should actually speak to her, the others discuss the people in their lives they most fear seeing and if they did what they would say to that person. Ted's thoughts of what he would say to her changes when he figures out her new circumstances.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTM5NTg0MDQ0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjIzMTIwMg@@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.1/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"8.1","votes":"1375","imdbid":"tt1256188","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
