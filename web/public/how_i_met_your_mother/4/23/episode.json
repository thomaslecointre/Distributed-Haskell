Instead of acting angry toward them, Ted is cordial, trying to prove that he is over Stella, which he truly does believe. Despite Ted's more than pleasant demeanor toward them, Tony has it in his mind that he has to make amends to Ted for stealing his fiancée since Ted, in his mind, looked so sad. After wealthy Tony makes some grand gestures to atone all which end up falling flat, Ted finally tells Tony how he really feels. Ted's comments lead to an unexpected outcome, which brings Stella running back to Ted. Ted, who really wants to be in love, has to decide what to do about Tony and Stella. Meanwhile, Barney has just received a speeding ticket. When he learns that all his friends have talked their way out of speeding tickets before, Barney bets them that he can as well. So Barney goes on a speeding mission, which too has an unexpected consequence.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDA3NDA2NTIyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDAzNzQ1Mg@@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.9/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"7.9","votes":"1638","imdbid":"tt1410619","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
