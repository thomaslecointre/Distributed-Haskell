They're constantly fighting, something they didn't do while they were dating and almost seemingly like roommates. They come to the conclusion that it was because they were sleeping with each other when they were dating. So they decide to be just roommates but have sex to circumvent the fights whenever they are about to have a fight. There is no emotional involvement, just sex. It seems to be working. Although they decide not to tell anyone of their roommates with benefits status, the rest of the gang find out. Lily believes that nothing good can come of their arrangement, as someone always gets hurt in the end. Although Lily can see it, the one who seems to be getting hurt by their arrangement is Barney, who still has unresolved feelings for Robin. Meanwhile, Marshall feels totally uncomfortable \"reading a magazine\" at work, and will do his \"magazine reading\" anywhere but the office, even once renting a motel room to do so. Can he always get away with his \"magazine reading\" away from the office when he's at the office?","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ5OTIxNjI3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzU1MjUyMg@@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.6/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"8.6","votes":"1647","imdbid":"tt1256173","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
