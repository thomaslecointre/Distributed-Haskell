Meanwhile, Ted's younger sister Heather is coming for a visit with the thought of actually moving to New York to begin a career in finance. Heather has always been a bit flaky in Ted's eyes and he can't see her making this move. But what Ted is most afraid of if Heather moves to New York is Barney, who has always wanted to sleep with Heather despite never having met her. Upon her arrival, Heather asks Ted to co-sign an apartment lease, otherwise there is no way she can move to the city. Ted, believing that Heather is too irresponsible, declines her request. Barney, Heather and Ted all try to use Lily to their advantage.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzOTA2MzIyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjk3MDMyMjE@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.2/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"8.2","votes":"1425","imdbid":"tt1256172","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
