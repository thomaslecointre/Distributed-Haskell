He refuses to take the job as an architecture professor since he sees that as a failure of not being an actual architect. So he takes the only design job offered to him: to design a restaurant, a rib joint, in the shape of a cowboy hat. For three solid days, this job is the focus of his life to the exclusion of all else including celebrating his birthday (much to his friends' chagrin, they who planned a surprise party for him on the rooftop). But Lily's pet goat throws a small wrench into Ted's life. Up on the roof, Marshall is contemplating making the literal six or seven foot horizontal leap to the roof of the adjacent building (where there is an inviting hot tub), missing which would mean falling several stories to the ground. Although he's thought about doing it for years, he seems closer now to doing it than ever. And Barney thinks that he's in love with Robin and plans on telling her so, until Robin pulls a \"Mosby\" on him.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5MTY5NDc4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDQ2NDY1Mg@@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.7/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"8.7","votes":"1648","imdbid":"tt1425523","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
