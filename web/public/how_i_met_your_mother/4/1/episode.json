She says yes. Later, Ted, after being questioned by Marshall, also comes to the realization that he knows very little about his bride-to-be. Ted, admitting this fact to her, starts to ask Stella a bunch of questions to find out more about her. One of the more important facts that he learns is that she's never seen Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977), his favorite movie of all time. Stella liking or not liking the movie could be a marriage breaker, especially as Ted is egged on by equally Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977) loving Marshall. Someone also in love is Barney: with Robin. Sensing that she knows something is going on, Barney confides in Lily. Lily gives him advice on how he can be her boyfriend (despite Barney denying that what he wants to be is anything called a boyfriend).","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAwOTg2NDM0NDBeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDM0ODM1OTE@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.7/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"8.7","votes":"1984","imdbid":"tt1256606","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
