Meanwhile, Robin receives what she considers an offer for her dream job, that as a news anchor. The problem is that the job is in Chicago. Leaving her four friends would be difficult enough, but she isn't sure if she wants to leave Don, who she is finally meshing with both professionally and personally. She turns to an unexpected source for advice. And Robin, Marshall and Lily, using psychology, talk Ted into dying his hair blond by telling him not to do it.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI4MDk3MzcwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzUwNDA1Mw@@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.5/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"8.5","votes":"1780","imdbid":"tt1648494","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
