So when Don calls to ask Robin for a date, she is about to say no until someone intervenes on her behalf. Conversely, Barney has been back to his womanizing ways. However, the latest woman he meets named Anita has been a conundrum as she appears to want to sleep with him, but at the last minute she turns down his sexual advances. Telling the gang this story, Ted realizes that Anita is using a tactic in a new guidebook for single women in how to empower themselves on the dating scene. When Barney finds out that Anita is not only using the strategies in the book but is the book's author, Barney, on Ted's advice, comes up with a plan to circumvent Anita's strategy. Later, the gang minus Barney learn that Barney meeting Anita was not by accident, and learn the reason for the not so accidental meeting.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTAwMDYyMzAwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODQzODIyMw@@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.4/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"8.4","votes":"1887","imdbid":"tt1609315","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
