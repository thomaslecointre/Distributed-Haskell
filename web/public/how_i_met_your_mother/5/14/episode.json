Marshall and Lily have lost yet another couple friends when information about Marshall and Lily's life is made public. Robin has yet to hear from her latest date, which bothers her despite thinking that he was boring. And Ted is having problems with a student in his class who he thought was putting him on. But the four find out that behind Barney's perfect week quest, he too is facing a major problem in his life. Only Lily believes Barney needs to get out from the perfect week quest and deal with his problem head on.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTY2MzgzODY3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzI5MDYxMw@@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.9/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"8.9","votes":"1735","imdbid":"tt1576524","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
