Despite not knowing exactly what it is but knowing that they would all have a good time at it, he got five ringside tickets to go see \"Robots vs. Wrestlers\" for himself, Ted, Marshall, Lily and Robin, knowing full well that Robin would now decline in her want to establish a relationship with Don away from specifically her two ex-boyfriends. Marissa Heller may be the cause of Ted also drifting away from the group, he who feels unappreciated whenever he tries to bring a little culture into the proceedings. So when the four crash an upscale party, Ted feels like he's met a crowd who he not only likes (including film director Peter Bogdanovich, political columnist Arianna Huffington and New York Times crossword puzzle editor Will Shortz), but who allow him to be cultured. But can Ted be cultured all the time? A recent doppelg√§nger sighting may provide him the answer. Meanwhile, Marshall and Lily wait for a specific sign to let them know when they should start a family.","languages":"English, Italian","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0NTA4MTE5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTczOTU0Mw@@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.2/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"8.2","votes":"1422","imdbid":"tt1632015","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
