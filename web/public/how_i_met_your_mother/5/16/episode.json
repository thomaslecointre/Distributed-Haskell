But after describing his and Tiffany's relationship to the gang, they all believe Ted is on her \"hook\" - that she will always just string him along while she dates other people. Ted believes that he is no such thing to her. Similarly, Ted does not believe that a librarian named Henrietta is on his hook, nor does Robin believe that a co-worker named Mike is on her hook. Lily does know however that Scooter, the guy she went to high school with and that crashed her and Marshall's wedding to profess his love to her, is on her hook as she sees him everyday since he works in the cafeteria at her school. She doesn't want him on her hook, but she just can't be that blunt to him, he with his sad puppy dog eyes. Marshall has a plan to help Lily release her hook. And Barney does agree with the others that Ted should break things off with Tiffany, that is until he learns what she does for a living.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzNTI2MjQxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTYwMjEyMw@@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.9/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"7.9","votes":"1687","imdbid":"tt1595724","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
