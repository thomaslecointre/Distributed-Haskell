Ted isn't too concerned as he wants to do it with her only when the time is right for both of them. But he learns from Stella that she is indeed a bit apprehensive about doing it since it's been five years since her last sexual encounter. This fact makes Ted also a little apprehensive since he's afraid that he won't measure up to her five year old expectation, so Marshall tells Ted to lower her expectation. But when they do decide that the time is right, Ted may have jeopardized the opportunity. Meanwhile, Ted still isn't speaking to Barney since he slept with Robin. As such, Barney is looking for a new wing man to replace Ted. He thinks he has the pick of any bro, but he ends up having only one applicant, his overly enthusiastic but slightly nerdish co-worker Randy. Barney thinks he can overcome Randy's shortcomings to make him the best wing man ever. It isn't until Barney learns of something in Randy's past that he truly does believe it.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BNjQ0NDc4NTQ1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDQ4MDMyMjE@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.1/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"8.1","votes":"1420","imdbid":"tt1206869","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
