He's only one of the reasons that Marshall hates his job. Having never been screamed at like Arthur has just done to him (in this case for not finishing a report by the deadline), Marshall reacts surprisingly. He asks for advice from his friends on how to handle his feelings associated with being screamed at. Barney thinks the only way for the universe to work is for Marshall to complete the chain of screaming: scream at someone else, they who in turn will scream at another person, and so on until someone eventually screams at the original screamer. Marshall instead decides to take Lily's advice and reason with Arthur. Marshall's reasoning doesn't come out quite the way he planned. Meanwhile, Ted buys a new car that he doesn't want anyone to get dirty or to move from its prime parking spot.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTIwMDAyMDYyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzI4MDMyMjE@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.1/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"8.1","votes":"1745","imdbid":"tt1206866","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
