Out of courtesy to his father who got him the opportunity, Marshall is still planning on going to the job interview with the law firm Nicholson, Hewitt and West, which represents some of the worst corporate citizens when it comes to the environment. The partner interviewing him, Jeff Coatsworth, ends up being not quite the old monster that Marshall was expecting, but rather a young, hip guy who offers what seems to be the world to Marshall, including wads of money. Despite knowing deep in their hearts that Jeff and his partners are evil personified, Lily seems to be nudging Marshall toward taking the law firm job. Besides Lily, only Robin knows why. Meanwhile, Barney learns that there is a porn star named Ted Mosby, which makes Ted Mosby the architect somewhat uncomfortable. Ted tries to find out if it's mere coincidence or why this porn star has assumed his name.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTkxNDI3NzY4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTk4MDMyMjE@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.2/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"8.2","votes":"1424","imdbid":"tt1117436","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
