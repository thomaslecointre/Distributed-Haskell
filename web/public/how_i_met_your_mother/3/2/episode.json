Lily implies that the folder should contain a personal letter, of which Marshall was not aware. He quickly writes a heartfelt letter to the love of his life. Unable to resist the urge, he opens Lily's letter which isn't quite what he was expecting. Robin, who had a good time in Argentina, can't seem to capture that joie de vivre she had while in Argentina, even though Gael is still doing those things he did in Argentina which made her so carefree. A move by Gael may show Robin if she really is cut out to be the \"Argentina Robin\". And impressed by how Gael attracts the women, Barney and Ted decide to take on that attribute they believe is attracting the women: being a foreigner who can only have a short term fling before heading home.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTA5MzAzNTcyNjZeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDUyMzE1MTk@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.8/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"7.8","votes":"1496","imdbid":"tt1115217","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
