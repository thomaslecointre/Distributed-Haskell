She warns him that he will have to go through ten one hour sessions and it it will be very painful. Ted understands and he wants to go out with her, but she can't, as long as Ted is her patient and it's a violation of AMA rules. In addition, she tells Ted up front when he suggests that they can go out when the sessions are over, the answer will be no. Ted is convinced that he can change that no into a yes after ten sessions. During these sessions, Ted tries to charm Stella, but it appears it's not working. One ploy he tries is to be very nice to Stella's receptionist, Abbey, but Stella still says no and Abbey is attracted to Ted. When session ten arrives, and the tattoo removal is complete, when Ted asks her once again, we find out why Stella can't go out on a date with him.
