But at the first dinner she has with the gang, it is obvious to Ted that none of the others like her. They refuse to tell him why, he needing to figure out himself her obvious flaw. The reason he may not be able to see her flaw is that he is still trying to sleep with her, that fact which places blind spots in people's perception. When Ted finally finds out the reason, he can't understand why he couldn't see it in the first place and why it didn't bother him before. But in knowing Cathy's flaw, the gang come to the realization that these blinders can also apply to friends. Meanwhile, the results of the bar exam have just been released. But Marshall can't access his exam results online since he lost his password. Can Marshall wait the probable six weeks until the results arrive in the snail mail? Barney thinks he has a way to find out... if Marshall is willing to do something extremely illegal. Marshall's annoying habit may prove to be the answer.","languages":"English, American Sign Language","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ4MTIzNDYxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTk4MDMyMjE@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"9.1/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"9.1","votes":"1971","imdbid":"tt1140904","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
