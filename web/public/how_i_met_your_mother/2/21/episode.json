In addition, one problem after another seems to be rearing its ugly head, including: Lily's veil being destroyed; their pregnant harp player being overdue; their photographer being injured; the flowers not scheduled to arrive until half way through the ceremony; Lily's high school boyfriend Scooter being there, he who still professes his love for her; and Marshall having an even worse than bad hair day. Lily doesn't want to be the type of bride who complains about the ceremony since all that should matter is her and Marshall's love for each other, but does she really care about having the perfect wedding? It may be a moot point as Ted thinks he's got the solution to make it a perfect day for his friends. Meanwhile, Barney figures out a way to get anything he wants on this particular day.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjA3MzM2ODI1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ3MDMyMjE@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.7/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"8.7","votes":"1598","imdbid":"tt0982196","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
