Part of the issue is that Robin believes that Ted's job is boring, and about which he rambles on and on, especially when he's had a bad day. Barney convinces Ted that his job may or may not be boring, but that he needs to be more convincing and suave in saying what he does for it to be attractive to the women. For fun, Ted tries using his job as a pick-up line to a beautiful woman - a kick-boxer named Anna - and it works. Robin hears about Ted picking up this woman, but she isn't overly concerned about what it means. But as Robin, with Lily by her side, goes on trek following Ted's movements that night, Robin becomes more concerned as it looks as if Ted is willing to go outside of his comfort zone to impress and thus sleep with Anna. Robin comes to a realization about herself as the night comes to a close.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxNDMzOTgzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDc3MDMyMjE@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.9/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"8.9","votes":"1900","imdbid":"tt0858000","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
