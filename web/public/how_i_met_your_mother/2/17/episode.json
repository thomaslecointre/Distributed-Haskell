The car represents his youth, which he is slowly losing to being a suit wearing corporate lawyer. So he plans on celebrating when the Fiero hits its 200,000th mile. With less than a mile to go with Ted already breaking out the cigars, the car dies. While the gang waits at the mechanic's shop to see if the Fiero will survive, they reminisce about memorable incidents that have happened in the car, in particular ones that bonded certain friendships. When Marshall learns that the car is repairable but will cost more than it's really worth, Marshall has to decide if the money is worth holding onto his past.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTA3MzQ1MDc5MTZeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDIyOTAzMjIx._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.3/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"8.3","votes":"1658","imdbid":"tt0969965","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
