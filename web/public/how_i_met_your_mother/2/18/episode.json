Marshall and Lily don't look at it like they're losing a roommate, but gaining their \"we can do whatever we want\" freedom. But as they spend more time alone without Ted, they come to realize what Ted actually brought into their household. Barney on the other hand is trying to prevent Ted from doing what he considers the worst mistake in his life by moving in with Robin. As such, Barney hijacks Ted's moving van with all of Ted's possessions inside. Barney is holding Ted's possession hostage unless Ted does whatever he tells him to do on what was supposed to be Ted and Robin's first night as roommates together. As Ted and Robin are not together for the evening, they both have time to think about what moving in together really means.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMwODQ0MTgzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTM5MDMyMjE@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.2/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"8.2","votes":"1640","imdbid":"tt0978049","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
