To prove that they aren't, Marshall and Lily decide to go ahead with their original plan of not sleeping with each other until their wedding night. Can they hold out that long? Ted and Lily are facing two other issues regarding the wedding, Ted's being that Marshall is continually censoring Ted's toast, and Lily's being that she needs to gain about five pounds to fit into her wedding dress properly, or else pay the $300 to get the dress altered. Both problems seem insurmountable as the wedding gets closer. Meanwhile, Barney is preparing for his upcoming appearance on the game show The Price Is Right (1972). Although Barney is certain he can win all the prizes he wants (with the exception of not mastering how to spin to the $1 space on the big wheel), he confesses that he has an ulterior motive to be on the show: to meet his biological father, Bob Barker.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTk1OTIxMDQzMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTc5MDMyMjE@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.9/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"8.9","votes":"1688","imdbid":"tt0994245","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
