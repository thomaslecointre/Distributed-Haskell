Although she is up front about why she fears the dwarfs, she refuses to tell Ted and the others about why she won't go to the mall. Marshall believes it's because she got married in a mall and is still married. Barney believes it has something to do with Robin having performed in a porn video. The two of them make a slap bet with each other: whoever is right gets to slap the other across the face as hard as he can. They even ask Lily to be the slap bet officiator, as long as she promises to be unbiased. Ted tries to find out Robin's secret, but she asks him to respect her privacy on this issue. When Ted does eventually pry it out of her, he wishes he didn't know as he doesn't know what to do with the information. But as time goes on, Barney actually finds out that it has to do with a video starring someone named Robin Sparkles. It is only then that Robin makes full disclosure. Meanwhile, the slap bet takes a few turns, but ends incomplete... for the time being.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM0NjE0NDg5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDc3MDMyMjE@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"9.4/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"9.4","votes":"3677","imdbid":"tt0885872","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
