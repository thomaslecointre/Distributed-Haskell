These feeling coincide with a visit to New York by Robin's seventeen year old baby sister, Katie Scherbatsky. Katie doesn't arrive alone, but with her two month boyfriend, Kyle, who is also visiting family in New York. Katie plans on losing her virginity to Kyle on this trip, something that Robin tries her hardest to talk her out of. Robin requests her friends' help in convincing Katie not to lose it to Kyle, but to wait for someone special. This request makes everyone discuss their first time, which brings up some controversy between Marshall and Lily based on Robin's first time. And Barney's first time comes straight out of a movie... or several movies.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg4MDI0ODg4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzM3MDMyMjE@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.3/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"8.3","votes":"1993","imdbid":"tt0897111","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
