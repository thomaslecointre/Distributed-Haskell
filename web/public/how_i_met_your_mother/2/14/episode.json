The 2007 edition of the game is different in that they have to attend a funeral the day of the game. They expect to be home in time for the 6:00 kick off, but just in case they're not, they're Tivo-ing the game. When the funeral goes longer than they expect and they miss the game altogether, Ted proposes that they watch the game on Monday night in eighteen hours to keep the tradition alive, but also to avoid finding out who won the game before watching it. It's difficult enough for Robin to avoid knowing since she works in the media and Ted since he is tasked with buying the hot wings at a sports bar for the game, but it ends up being just as difficult a situation unexpectedly for Marshall. Barney, on the other hand, does whatever he can to find out who won since he's got a lot of money riding on the outcome.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjEzMDU2MzM4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzc3MDMyMjE@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.4/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"8.4","votes":"1603","imdbid":"tt0933496","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
