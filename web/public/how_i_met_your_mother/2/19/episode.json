Barney plans on hiring a stripper anyway. But when Ted tells Barney on the way that they are not going to Atlantic City but to Foxwoods instead (since Ted knew Barney would have a stripper waiting in Atlantic City), Ted thinks he's pulled one over on Barney. In turn, Barney pulls a maneuver which he thinks has outfoxed the fox, although Barney's new plan doesn't come off quite the way he or anyone else quite expects. Meanwhile, Lily is having her bridal shower. Barney talks Robin into buying Lily a vibrator as a gift. When Robin arrives at the shower, she sees that it is not the vibrator type crowd. Feeling embarrassed if anyone at the shower sees what she's bought, Robin does whatever she can throughout the evening to retrieve her gift from the gift table without anyone seeing what she's done or worse seeing the gift itself.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0OTYwOTYyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDQ5MDMyMjE@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.5/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"8.5","votes":"1896","imdbid":"tt0966112","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
