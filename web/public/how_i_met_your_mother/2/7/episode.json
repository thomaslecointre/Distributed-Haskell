With Marshall now being single, Ted and Barney encourage him to go after her. Chloe, as she is named, is indeed interested in him. But later when Marshall and Chloe run into Ted and Barney, Ted and Barney encourage Marshall to not date her. The reason?: she has \"crazy eyes\", which is indicative of a crazy personality. But Marshall doesn't heed their warning and goes out on a date with her. On their date, it's not Chloe that ends up coming off as crazy. Meanwhile, the gang are now calling Barney by a new name, a name that was written on his cup at the coffee house: Swarley. The more he says he hates the name, the more they all call him that and variations of it.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3ODgxNDI1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODc3MDMyMjE@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"9.0/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"9.0","votes":"2740","imdbid":"tt0875360","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
