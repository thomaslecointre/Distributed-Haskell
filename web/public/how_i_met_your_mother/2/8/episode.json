After some convincing by Marshall for Lily to woo him the right way, they do decide to get married. A perceived problem is that most of Marshall's family now hate Lily for walking out on him in the first place. To avoid the wrath of the Eriksen's at a wedding ceremony, Marshall and Lily decide to go to Atlantic City to elope, with only their three closest friends by their side. Although some do have some work issues to get around, all three of Ted, Robin and Barney head off to Atlantic City for the event. But once there, Marshall and Lily run into an obstacle that it takes three days to get a marriage license in New Jersey. Lily in particular does whatever she has to to make sure they get married on this day. Meanwhile, the guys seem more preoccupied with being tourists in Atlantic City than they are with the wedding. Ted is preoccupied with Robin's less than formal wedding attire. And Barney is preoccupied with some mysterious Chinese who seem to know him really well.","languages":"English, Mandarin","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDgwMzM4NDc1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzY3MDMyMjE@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.0/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"8.0","votes":"1682","imdbid":"tt0885871","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
