He decides to take refuge at Ted's new apartment. As Marshall is also there, Ted suggests that they make the evening their boys only triennial viewing of the Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977) trilogy, this triennial event which began in 2000 when Ted and Marshall were still at Wesleyan. Although the trilogy is the centerpiece of the get together, it has historically been more about where their life is at that the present time, predicting what their lives will be like in three years time at their next viewing, and reflecting on why their prediction from three years ago went so awry. In most respects, the 2003, 2006 and 2009 events were remarkably similar, but many current issues make the 2012 event a bit different.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjA2MTM1OTYyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzc4MDMyMjE@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.6/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"8.6","votes":"1596","imdbid":"tt2336905","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
