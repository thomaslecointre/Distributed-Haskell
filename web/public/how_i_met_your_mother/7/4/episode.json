The assault had something to do with her feelings for Barney, and not being able to deal emotionally with watching Barney court Nora, especially in the public and over-the-top manner he was doing it. As Robin tells the story, which includes her helping Barney as a \"friend\" erase the many loose hanging scams to pick up women so that Nora will think him a changed man, Robin's therapist, Kevin, gets more and more exasperated by the long winded nature of Robin's story. Part of that exasperation comes from what he sees as a tangent to the story he wants and needs to hear, but that Robin swears is cogent to the assault charge. That tangent concerns Ted inserting himself into Lily's pregnancy, as he has always seen himself, Marshall and Lily as an unbreakable threesome, like three peas in a pod. As Ted especially had issues with advice doled out by Dr. Sonya - Lily's somewhat free-spirited obstetrician - Marshall, Lily and ultimately Ted had to figure out what role, if any, Ted was going to play in the pregnancy.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyNTU4OTQyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTQ0NzI4Ng@@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.2/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"8.2","votes":"1780","imdbid":"tt2049980","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
