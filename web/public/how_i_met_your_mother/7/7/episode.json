Kevin, in turn, states that it's not too unusual for people to end up with someone like their parent. That comment makes for a very uncomfortable romantic night for Marshall and Lily, the former whose discomfort is taken one step further. If Barney knew about James and Kevin's comments, his night may also be particularly spoiled as tonight is the night that he and Nora are going to make love for the first time. But other things may ruin their potential first time. Meanwhile, Kevin and Ted have to come to an understanding about the other's relationship with Robin.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwNTQzODY5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODcyNTU5Ng@@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.8/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"7.8","votes":"1441","imdbid":"tt2072525","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
