To help Ted get over her, Barney persuades him to try online dating, even down to picking the women Ted should date. But when Ted goes on these dates, he sees only one thing: Robin. He has to figure out if that actually means that he is still in love with her despite needing to get over her. Meanwhile, Barney himself has gotten to the point of being jealous of all the men Quinn meets professionally. As much as he likes certain parts of her being a stripper, he does whatever he can to persuade her to quit and find another job. And although it is still five weeks until Lily's due date, Marshall is treating the time like the baby has already arrived, which is driving Lily crazy and making both a little sleep deprived. Lily has her own plan of getting Marshall back into the here and now.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3MDgxNTM4OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDgwMjM3Nw@@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.8/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"7.8","votes":"1285","imdbid":"tt2376741","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
