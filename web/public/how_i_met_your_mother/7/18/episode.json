Meanwhile, as Robin has moved out of Ted's apartment after Marshall told her that staying would only hurt Ted in the long run, Ted tries to move on by figuring out something useful to do with Robin's old bedroom. Robin, not knowing where to go, is temporarily staying with Marshall and Lily in their Long Island house. Robin's stay may be longer than she first anticipated if only because Marshall and Lily, who have settled into suburban bliss, won't let her leave.
