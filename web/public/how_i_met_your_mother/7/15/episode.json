Her premonition came true. Over a five minute period during the party, a series of events that took place simultaneously in the living room, dining room and kitchen resulted in what to the untrained eye looked like a confusing mess if knowledge of only what was happening in one of those three rooms was known, but made total sense when viewed from all three rooms combined. Some of the issues and topics of conversation that led to the disaster included Robin's confrontational nature versus Ted's non-confrontational nature, Marshall pondering whether he should refuse boss Garrison Cootes' demand that they return to work in the middle of the party, Mickey's new beekeeping hobby, what happened to a plate of vegan spring rolls, why Lily didn't want anyone to eat the block of Gouda that Marshall served, and Barney's even more than usual adoration of his penis.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMzUzNzM2NDYzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODQ3MDMyMjE@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.1/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"7.1","votes":"1631","imdbid":"tt2216757","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
