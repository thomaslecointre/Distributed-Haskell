Robin leaves Ted with something to think about: a kiss and a vow to talk about their situation when she returns. But when Ted turns to Marshall and subsequently Lily for advice, Marshall offers words of hope and Lily offer a declaration that he and Robin were never meant to be together. Based on something that Barney discovers under Marshall and Lily's bed, Ted comes to realize why Marshall and Lily so often take different sides on an issue. Before Robin returns, Ted believes he knows what her answer is going to be. When Robin returns and does give Ted her answer, Marshall and Lily have differing opinions on whether her answer is definitive. Meanwhile, Barney searches high and low through Marshall and Lily's house for a videotape of them having sex, which Lily denies exists.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIwOTc2NzY4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDM3MjM0Nw@@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.5/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"8.5","votes":"1882","imdbid":"tt2212411","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
