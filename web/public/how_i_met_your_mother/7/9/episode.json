Safety conscious Ted wanted to leave the city before the approaching hurricane. While Barney, Lily and Robin thought that Ted was overreacting, Marshall, who was between jobs and had just lost his medical insurance until his new job started in two weeks, was suffering from hypochondria and wanted to leave. But telephone calls from various parents, news of the strength of the hurricane as it got closer and closer to New York, and interpersonal relationships between the five at that time made them continually change their individual minds about whether to go or stay. Meanwhile, Barney is at a point of doing whatever he can to get out of wearing the ducky tie. He thinks he has a way to convince Marshall to let him get out of wearing the tie. As Marshall ponders Barney's deal, Kevin adds his therapist two-cents into the matter.","languages":"English, French","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDAwMjg4NjEzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDM3MDMyMjE@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.4/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"8.4","votes":"1867","imdbid":"tt2094413","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
