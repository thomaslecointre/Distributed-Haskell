For Lily and Marshall, they receive an unexpected and somewhat unwanted house guest: Mickey. Mickey, who grew up in that house, believes he is helping Lily and Marshall by pointing out what they can and cannot do with every aspect of the house. Lily/Marshall and Mickey come to a stalemate when they negotiate Mickey's living arrangement versus his help in fixing the broken fuse which has resulted in the house being in total darkness. At MacLaren's, Ted, Barney and Robin are lamenting the empty half a booth where Lily and Marshall generally sat, and which will now be emptier than usual. However, Barney comes to the realization that Lily was generally the boss of their group, and thus now he plans on taking over. That leads to an evening which has them finding unexpected surrogates for Lily and Marshall. And Robin and Kevin are still at the stage in their relationship where they want to prove to the other that they are up for doing almost anything, even if they're not.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5MzM5NzU2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzMyMzYyNw@@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.8/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"7.8","votes":"1874","imdbid":"tt2157457","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
