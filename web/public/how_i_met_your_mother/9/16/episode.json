This story starts on the very same day he started his own story, the day that Marshall and Lily got engaged, and the day he met Robin. This day was their mother's twenty-first birthday, the day her then boyfriend Max, who was the love of her life and the one and only person she thought she would ever love, died. His death affected how she approached her dating life over much of the intervening time. Ted also tells them of the many close calls the two of them had in meeting, including when she, as an economics student who wanted to end world poverty, was in the classroom he thought was his classroom for his very first day as an architecture professor, and how she became roommates with Cindy, a woman who he ended up dating. The story also tells of how she ended up in Farhampton at the same time as Robin and Barney's wedding and how she ended up in the room next to his at the inn, when he first heard her voice, a situation that would be a memorable one for him for the rest of his life.","languages":"English, French","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjEzNjA1MzU5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjE0MzMwMTE@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"9.5/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"9.5","votes":"5674","imdbid":"tt3390684","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
