Marvin, however, is cranky, so Marshall does the only thing that will get him to sleep - something that Lily discovered worked recently - which is to read him poems in rhyme. But Marshall left Marvin's rhyming book in the Hummer, leaving Marshall to come up with rhyming stories of his own, with the help and often exasperation of his fellow passengers. As one rhyme works, something happens on the bus to awaken Marvin again crying. The stories that Marshall tells Marvin, however inappropriate, are: \"Mosby at the Bat\", where Ted tries to figure out if a dinner he is having with a Physics professor named Lisa is a business dinner or a date; \"Robin Takes the Cake\", where Robin steals and eats a wedding cake and the reason why; and \"Barney Stinson: Player King of New York City\", where Barney, while contemplating hitting on a woman in the bar, explains why, against Lily's assertions to the contrary, that he will indeed be able to pick her up.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTAwMDQxODIxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTE5MDMyMjE@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"5.8/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"5.8","votes":"3294","imdbid":"tt3331436","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
