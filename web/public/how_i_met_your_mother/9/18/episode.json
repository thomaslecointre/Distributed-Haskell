All their efforts to revive him don't work, which they have to do quickly to get him to the wedding photo shoot. They figure the only person who would have the answer to get Barney out of his drunken stupor is Barney himself, who has always been able to help the others with their hangovers by giving them his legendary but secret Stinson Hangover Fixer Elixir. Based on those past experiences, they are able to piece together all the ingredients to brew their own elixir except one, the top secret ingredient which probably is the most important as it is the one that Barney has been most secretive. As they collect the unusual ingredients, they try whatever they can to get Barney conscious long enough to get the name of that secret ingredient from him. Deep down, Ted and Marshall are hoping that they can't revive him until after the photo shoot so that Barney can have his fantasy photo shoot. On an associated issue, each of the four, based on Barney's current situation, vow never to get that drunk ever again. Ted, in 2030, tells his kids whether any of the four was able to keep to that vow.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2MDkxMjk5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODY3OTMyMTE@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.1/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"8.1","votes":"1844","imdbid":"tt3415288","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
