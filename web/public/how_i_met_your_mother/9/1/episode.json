Marshall has picked Marvin up in St. Cloud and is flying back to New York. A photo of Marshall and Marvin that Judy has just posted on the Internet has the potential to ruin Marshall and Lily's marriage if Lily sees it, and may also threaten Marshall's ability to make it back to New York in time for the wedding. Ted and Lily are driving out to Farhampton together. Ted wants the trip to be the best road trip ever, but his idea and Lily's idea of a fun road trip are totally different. Ted has ulterior motives for having his type of fun on this trip. Lily, not being able to take Ted anymore, decides to ditch him part way and take the train instead. She meets someone on the train that understands what she's going through. That person has the potential to be a life long friend, much like Robin has become. And Ranjit is driving Robin and Barney to Farhampton in his limousine. As Robin and Barney talk about those people invited that may ruin the wedding, they come across some information that could threaten the wedding altogether.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg0NDMzMjM0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODk4ODAwMDE@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.9/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"7.9","votes":"2519","imdbid":"tt2802532","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
