The actual lamp breaking took place while Robin, her sister and Lily were playing hockey in the room, which was followed by Robin, Lily and Marshall watching \"The Wedding Bride Too!\" on pay-per-view, the movie the second written by Stella's ex-husband about Ted with regard to his relationship with Stella. But Lily was angry with Robin that in these activities she wasn't treating the morning as special as it should be considering that it was her wedding day. Lily went to extreme and potentially friend-busting measures to accomplish what she wanted Robin to feel. At the same time, Ted himself was helping Barney with the choice of which suit to wear for the wedding. After the five convened together, two major revelations occurred as the punch line to this story, the first of those revelations which was not so much a surprise, while the second one was.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA0MjYzNzk4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODI2NDkyMTE@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.8/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"7.8","votes":"1883","imdbid":"tt3415292","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
