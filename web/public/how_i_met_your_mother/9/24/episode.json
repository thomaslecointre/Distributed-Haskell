Ted and their mother still have not made it to the altar, despite both of the kids already having been born, the delay due to timing issues and wedding priorities. Marshall finally receives that much wanted call telling him that he has been offered a judgeship. It's a few years after Robin and Barney's divorce, with Barney having returned to his carousing ways. A major event that occurred in carrying out the new plays in his playbook ended up having what would be the most profound change in his mentality. The \"except\" part concerns Robin, who is now largely out of their lives, despite the six of them vowing that they would be there for each other for all the big events. Ted looks back once again to his initial meeting with their mother and why it seemed like destiny to be with her, before he concludes the story with what he believes is its moral. His kids, however, believe there is another underlying reason why he told them the story, a reason he may not even fully realize yet.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"N/A","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"5.7/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"5.7","votes":"11477","imdbid":"tt3415304","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
