Daphne and Marshall, caught in a major storm, decide to take temporary refuge in Cleveland at the home of Ted's mother, Virginia, and her current husband, Clint. They may regret doing so after they find something in their vehicle leaving Cleveland, that something which was meant to assist in resolving the issues between the two of them. And Ted wants to visit the lighthouse near the inn, but he doesn't know how to get there and the inn clerk, Curtis, won't give him a map to it as Curtis feels it is such a romantic spot that single Ted will use the opportunity to jump off it and kill himself.
