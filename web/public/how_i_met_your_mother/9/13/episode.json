Meanwhile, someone associated with the wedding that neither Robin or Lily seems to know approaches them. As they try to figure out who he is, he ends up working his charm on them, before something he says ends up driving them apart, perhaps forever. That same person does exactly the same thing later with Barney and Ted. Marshall's current chauffeur may be able to shed some light on who this person is, and why a \"bass player wanted\" ad is the final straw for her in wanting to get her revenge on him. And Ted and Barney discuss what Ted sees as Barney's overuse of the phrase \"that's the dream\". They have to decide what really is \"the dream\" for both of them.","languages":"English","country":"USA","awards":"N/A","poster":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI3NjU2NTQ3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDE0NDk3MDE@._V1_SX300.jpg","ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.3/10"}],"metascore":"N/A","rating":"8.3","votes":"1961","imdbid":"tt3382270","seriesid":"tt0460649","type":"episode","response":"True"}
